## Description
Welcome! For this assignment, I have created a Budget Tracker App. The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, they should populate the total when brought back online.

Offline Functionality:

  * Enter deposits offline

  * Enter expenses offline

When brought back online:

  * Offline entries should be added to tracker.

  ## Installation

To begin, I had to install my dependencies that are to be utlizied (Compression, Express, Lite-Server, Mongoose, Morgan) :

  ```
  npm i
  ```

  ## Usage

 To launch this application to Localhost:3000 please enter the following:

```
npm start
```
